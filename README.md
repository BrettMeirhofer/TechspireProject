Title: Techspire Bakery CIS3365 Class Project
 
Purpose: To demonstrate skills in Python, JS/Css/Html, SQL, database design, teamwork, and source control by developing a complete web-app with a front-end, back-end, and database as a ten person team.

Description: This is a prototype Bakery Loyalty System app. It is meant to supplement an existing POS (Point of sale) system by allowing cashiers to add customers and transactions to a database that keeps track of customer stats. Customers earn loyalty points by buying products eligible for the loyalty system and can then spend those points on rewards with the aid of a Cashier.
