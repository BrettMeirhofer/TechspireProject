-- Employee Social Media
-- Selects all employees who have social media and displays their handle along with their address and contact information.
-- The client can use this report to contact active or inactive employees with social media and pay or ask them to promote the store using their social media accounts. Each employee has their address listed so that the client can see the scope of each employee’s influence. People usually have a lot of followers from the same city or area, so understanding the range of each employee’s social media influence can help the client choose the right employee to promote the business.
